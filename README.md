# How to learn modern Javascript

A guide to the adventurer.

## Description
Javascript has become, over the years, one of the most used programming languages in the world. First it was only used on the browser (client side without frameworks or with frameworks like React, Angular or Vue). Then it was used also in the server side with Node.js. Then it started appearing also in the desktop with the Electron GUI ( [Visual Studio Code editor](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is one of the best examples, as is the [Joplin](https://joplinapp.org/) note system). Then it appeared in mobile development with the [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) . It's also used for Machine Learning [TensorFlow.js](https://www.tensorflow.org/js) and for embedded development in micro-controllers. So currently, Javascript is all over the place in all possible development areas. <br>

In this page I will list some of the links that I have found to be more interesting to a person that is starting to learn Javascript. <br>

Obviously, this is only a starting point in a journey. But I think it's  good start. <br>

# Electron the desktop client GUI for Javascript

## Description
Electron is a multi-platform (Windows, Linux, Mac) desktop Client GUI that uses the browser Chromium in one or more windows of desktop. It also uses Node.js and Javascript. It comes with tools that generate execution files, automatic installation and update of the application. Has API's for the direct access to native hardware, like files, printers, notifications and much more. The applications made in Electron normally are really fast. The Visual Studio Code editor, the Atom editor and the Joplin note system are good examples of applications made with Electron.
